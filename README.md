# Altitude Measurements Improve Predictions of Battery Voltage in an Electric Bicycle: Demo code for submission to IEEE-TCAS-II


This code reproduces the results presented in F. Tobar et. al., “Altitude Measurements Improve Predictions of Battery Voltage in an Electric Bicycle”, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefsa. The demo is provided in a Jupyter notebook in the form of a demo with all the data files and codes.

If this code is to be used by others, please contact me (ftobar-A-dim-D-uchile-D-cl, replace -A-=”@” and -D-=”.”) for updated information on the appropriate citation.
